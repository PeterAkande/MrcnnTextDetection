# MrcnnTextDetection

This is a text detection project using Mask RCNN;
Results are not optimal due to limited data(only 250 samples);
But still it helped me grasp the basics and tune of object detection..
This [blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-train-an-object-detection-model-with-keras/) was very useful 

The mrcnn_pretrained_weights can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5)
